Let's Get to Know Each Other: I'm Rafif

Hi, I'm **Rafif Muhammad Muflihur Rodwa**, but you can just call me **Rafif**. I'm the **Co-Founder of Micholabs**, as well as a **Frontend Developer & UI/UX Designer** who loves building digital experiences that are intuitive, fast, and modern.

How I Fell in Love with Tech and Design

My interest in startups began back in **high school (11th grade)**, when I first discovered the world of technology and dreamed of building my own startup one day.

That dream led me to **study Computer Science at university**, where I could dive deeper into the tech world.

Since **2022**, I've been honing my skills in building web interfaces with **React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS**, while also designing user experiences using **Figma**. Recently, I've been exploring **Rust** and enjoy combining design and code to create meaningful digital products.

Outside of coding and design, I love writing **blog posts**, experimenting with **new ideas** (stay tuned for my upcoming **AI Chat Code project**), and occasionally doing hands-on work such as **trading** and even **farming** 🌱.

The Birth of Micholabs

Micholabs started from a casual conversation between me, **Omi, Daffa, and Fildzanu**. We once worked together on a project and realized that we shared the same vision.

> For us, building a startup isn't just about having a name, a logo, or working hours.  
> It's about how we **connect as a team, grow together, and truly understand the purpose** we want to achieve.

We believe that everyone plays an important role. No one is smarter or superior — **we are all equal** and constantly learning from one another.

That's why we decided to create **Micholabs**: a collaborative space where we can keep growing, while helping others grow with us.

My Hopes for the Future

For me, Micholabs is not just about creating cool digital products. More than that, I want Micholabs to be a place where:

- Communication is always alive
- There are no egos
- Everyone is equal and continues learning from each other

I also hope Micholabs can **open opportunities for students and interns** to learn and gain real experience, so they won't struggle to find a place to grow.

Ultimately, I want Micholabs to become a space that **supports everyone** — from our own team members to clients and the tech community around us.
