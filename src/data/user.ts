  about: `
Hello, World! I’m Rafif M.M.R — a hybrid Frontend Developer & UI/UX Designer passionate about building intuitive, fast, and modern digital experiences.

Since 2022, I’ve been crafting web interfaces using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, while also designing seamless user journeys with Figma. I recently started exploring Rust and enjoy combining code with design in meaningful ways.

Beyond work, I love diving into new technologies, writing blogs, experimenting with ideas (stay tuned for my upcoming AI Chat Code project 👀), and even spending time in the field literally, as I enjoy trading and farming too.
